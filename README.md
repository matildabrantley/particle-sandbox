## Description
Explore a world of emergent 2D particle interactions formed from simple rules of attraction and repulsion of various particle types. Originally created in Jan 2018.

## Features 
Three fundamental forces loosely simulated:
* Gravity: Long-range attraction between particles or between particles and a massive body (ground).
* Electromagnetism: Medium-range attraction and repulsion between charged particles.
* Strong Nuclear: Short-range intense attraction between certain particles.
Other custom forces exist to explore unique interactions and emergent effects not found in real quantum mechanics (or re-interpreting particles as living cells or organisms instead of fundamental particles).
